          m3dev - tools for embedded ARM Cortex M3 development
===========================================================================

This project is a collection of (linux-centric) tools for working on
small embedded systems based on the ARM Cortex M3 CPU.

Original work was done with a STM32F103 part, and much more work has been
done with LPC13xx series parts.

Everything is either Apache 2 or BSD licensed, to allow for easy,
no-strings-attached, inclusion in your own projects.  Share and enjoy!


m3debug
-------

Firmware for the "m3debug" and "super-m3debug" boards which use the
LPC1343 as an engine for the ARM Serial Wire Debug Protocol, in 
conjunction with the debugger and gdb-bridge programs (described
below).

A schematic is provided for the original (pretty simplistic) m3debug
board.


swdp 
----

Firmware for the LeafLabs Maple board to act as a USB<->SW-DP bridge,
to allow host software to use Serial Wire Debug Protocol to access target
devices.  It should be usable on just about any STM32F103 board.

GPIO 0 -> SWDIO
GPIO 1 -> SWCLK
GPIO 5 -> Activity LED

This was the original prototype and has not been tested in a looong
time now.


debugger & gdb-bridge
---------------------

A simple standalone debugger and a bridge for the GDB remote protocol
that commicate with a board running swdp.


stm32boot
---------

A tool to download code to RAM or flash, via the stm32f1xx ROM serial
bootloader.


usbmon
------

Commandline tool to observe the linux usb stack and io transactions
through /dev/usbmon*


Included Third Party Software
-----------------------------

  excellent tiny commandline editor (BSD license)

Useful Documents
----------------

ARM DDI0337E Cortex M3 r1p1 Technical Reference Manual
  Has useful details on SW-DP and debug peripherals that was removed
  in later versions of the TRM as "redundant" with other documents.


Historical Notes
----------------

The original work on this started in 2011 and has been tinkered with
on a number of repositories by a number of people.  Trying to fold things
back together and tidy up the build system, etc, ended up being a bit of
a mess resulting in Brian declaring "history bankruptcy" and starting
a fresh repository in 2014.

Some random side projects have been removed.  An AUTHORS file has been
added to provide credit for additional contributors to the codebase.

The code base as of the initial checkin, built with gcc 4.8.2 and
binutils 2.24 (http://github.com/travisg/toolchains) is verified to
be able to use a m3debug board to flash the bootloader and app image
to another m3debug board, which then can repeat the process.
