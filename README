          m3dev - tools for embedded ARM Cortex M3 development
===========================================================================

This project is a collection of (linux-centric) tools for working on
small embedded systems based on the ARM Cortex M3 CPU.

Original work was done with a STM32F103 part, but it will not stop there.

Everything is either Apache 2 or BSD licensed, to allow for easy,
no-strings-attached, inclusion in your own projects.  Share and enjoy!


swdp
----

Firmware for the LeafLabs Maple board to act as a USB<->SW-DP bridge,
to allow host software to use Serial Wire Debug Protocol to access target
devices.  It should be usable on just about any STM32F103 board.

GPIO 0 -> SWDIO
GPIO 1 -> SWCLK
GPIO 5 -> Activity LED


debugger & gdb-bridge
---------------------

A simple standalone debugger and a bridge for the GDB remote protocol
that commicate with a board running swdp.


stm32boot
---------

A tool to download code to RAM or flash, via the stm32f1xx ROM serial
bootloader.


usbmon
------

Commandline tool to observe the linux usb stack and io transactions
through /dev/usbmon*


Included Third Party Software
-----------------------------

linenoise.[ch] 
  excellent tiny commandline editor (BSD license)
  https://github.com/antirez/linenoise

usb-linux.c
  toolbox code for using usb linux devices from userspace
  from the Android Open Source Project (BSD license)


Useful Documents
----------------

ARM DDI0337E Cortex M3 r1p1 Technical Reference Manual
  Has useful details on SW-DP and debug peripherals that was removed
  in later versions of the TRM as "redundant" with other documents.
