Cortex M3
---------
- All M3 vectors are interwork style and MUST have the low bit set.
  Failure to do so will result in hardfaults on reset, etc.

- You can start debugging from reset by asserting RESET, writing 1 to 
  E000EDFC, then releasing RESET

Linux Generic Serial Driver
---------------------------
- class/subclass/protocol 0xff,0x00,0x00 (device and interface)
- 1 interface, 1 bulk in, 1 bulk out
- must modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0525 product=0xA4A6
- must rmmod usbserial before modprobing it if it was previously loaded
- publishes as /dev/ttyUSBx

STM32F1xx
---------
- clock config at boot:
  - HSI (internal 8MHz osc) is on and ready
  - SYSCLK = HSI (8MHz)
  - AHB = SYSCLK / 1
  - PCLK1 = HCLK / 1
  - PCLK2 = HCLK / 1
  - ADCCLK = PCLK2 / 2 (4MHz)

LPC1343
-------
- how to trap just before the bootloader jumps to user flash
  reset-stop
  watch-rw 0
  go

gdb
---
making the disassembler behave:
  set architecture armv4m
  set arm fallback-mode thumb

connecting/disconnecting:
  target remote | out/gdb-bridge
  disconnect

turn on tracing for the remote wire protocol
  set debug remote 1

disassemble 4 instructions at pc
  x/4i $pc
